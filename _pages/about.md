<p class="post-description"> Ph.D. Candidate at Cornell University <br>Pepiot Research Group <br> Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering </p>

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University advised by [Professor Perrine Pepiot](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/perrine-pepiot) in the Mechanical and Aersopace Engineering Department. I recently worked as a graduate intern at the [National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) in the [High-Performance Algorithms and Complex Fluids Group](https://www.nrel.gov/computational-science/high-performance-algorithms-complex-fluids.html).

My Ph.D. research is focused on developing reduced-order models for chemically reacting, turbulent flow simulations. Most recently, I've been developing ways to use machine learning frameworks to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical state and to robustly evolve the chemical state for predictive capabilities. I have experience coding in Python, Fortran, and C/C++, as well as using a variety of machine learning packages. When I'm not coding and doing research, I like to rock climb, fix/ride bicycles, and spend time with my dog Bonnie.

I plan to graduate this coming Fall 2023 and am currently looking for full-time job opportunities post-graduation.
